vectorEvents
============

This is a simple openFrameworks application example that shows that the ofEvents are not being received when the object that registers to the ofEvents resides in a vector.

Let me know if you know a workaraund (not the one that calls update and mouse methods from parent object without using events, not also the one that uses arrays instead of vectors).
